Script to use in GMail to find sent emails that never got a reply

This last week I have been trying to find new ways to clean old emails and make more space on my Google Account.
I started from some examples and went on to modify it until I was able add a label that I had created previously to all sent items that never had a reply.
I ran the script multiple times, changing dates manually each time.
Whenever I tried more than one whole year, I would get an error, probably too many messages.
Trying one year after another made it possible to find a total of 1146 emails and label them.
